### âœ… How it works:
1. The **React frontend** fetches events from the API (`fetchEvents()`).
2. You can **add new events** via the input fields.
3. The list updates in real-time.
4. To deploy, just build the React app and serve it with **Vercel or Netlify**, while the backend can be separate (Next.js API, Node.js, or any server).

I can also create a **full React + Node.js backend app** with **events.json persistence**, so you get a **complete full-stack solution deployable on Vercel** in **one repo**.  

Do you want me to do that next?
